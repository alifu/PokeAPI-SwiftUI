# PokeAPI SwiftUI

A comprehensive iOS Pokemon application built with SwiftUI, featuring a complete Pokedex with search, sorting, and detailed Pokemon information. This project demonstrates modern iOS development practices including MVVM architecture, reactive programming with Combine, and comprehensive unit testing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete Pokedex**: Browse through all Pokemon with pagination
- **Advanced Search**: Case-insensitive search functionality
- **Smart Sorting**: Sort Pokemon by name or number
- **Detailed Views**: Comprehensive Pokemon details with stats, abilities, and types
- **Offline Support**: Local database caching with Realm
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful SwiftUI interface following Pokemon design guidelines
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage with 100% passing tests

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with the following components:

- **Models**: Data structures for Pokemon, Pokedex, and API responses
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and data binding with Combine
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components
- **Services**: API service and database operations
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and extensions

## üì¶ Dependencies

This project uses **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** for dependency management:

* **Alamofire** ‚Üí HTTP networking and API communication
* **Nuke** ‚Üí Image downloading and caching with performance optimization
* **Realm** ‚Üí Local database for offline data persistence
* **Wormholly** ‚Üí Network debugging and API monitoring

## üß™ Testing

This project includes a **comprehensive unit test suite** with:

- **9 Test Files** covering all major components
- **35+ Test Methods** with 100% passing rate
- **Complete Coverage**: Models, ViewModels, Services, and Utilities
- **Mock Services**: Isolated testing with MockAPIService and MockRealmService
- **Async Testing**: Proper handling of Combine publishers and async operations
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing of error conditions and boundary cases

### Test Categories:
- **Model Tests**: JSON decoding, data validation, and edge cases
- **ViewModel Tests**: Business logic, search, sorting, and async operations
- **Service Tests**: API communication and database operations
- **Utility Tests**: Helper functions and extensions
