## Running Tests

### Command Line
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme PokeAPI-SwiftUI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Run specific test class
xcodebuild test -scheme PokeAPI-SwiftUI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:PokeAPI_SwiftUITests/PokedexViewModelTests

# Run specific test method
xcodebuild test -scheme PokeAPI-SwiftUI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:PokeAPI_SwiftUITests/PokedexViewModelTests/testSearchTextFiltering
```

### Xcode
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the test target
3. Press `Cmd + U` to run all tests
4. Use the test navigator to run individual tests

## Test Data

### Mock Data Structure
The test suite uses comprehensive mock data that mirrors the real API responses:

```swift
// Example mock data
static let samplePokedexResponse = Pokedex.Response(
    count: 1154,
    next: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=20&limit=20",
    previous: nil,
    results: [
        Pokedex.Result(url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/", name: "bulbasaur"),
        Pokedex.Result(url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/", name: "ivysaur")
    ]
)
```

### Mock Services
- **MockAPIService**: Simulates API responses with configurable success/error states
- **MockRealmService**: Simulates database operations without requiring actual Realm setup

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Each test class focuses on a single component
- Tests are grouped by functionality
- Clear naming conventions for test methods

### Test Data
- Consistent mock data across all tests
- Realistic data that matches API responses
- Edge cases and error conditions covered

### Assertions
- Specific assertions for expected behavior
- Error condition validation
- Performance benchmarks where applicable

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Tests
- [ ] UI component tests using SwiftUI testing framework
- [ ] Network integration tests with real API
- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Localization tests

### Test Improvements
- [ ] Increase code coverage to 90%+
- [ ] Add property-based testing
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing for UI components
- [ ] Add continuous integration test automation

## Dependencies

The test suite uses the following testing frameworks and tools:
- **XCTest**: Core testing framework
- **Combine**: For testing reactive programming patterns and async operations
- **Alamofire**: For API service testing and mock implementations
- **SwiftUI**: For UI component testing
- **Realm**: For database testing (mocked with MockRealmService)

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Use descriptive test method names
4. Add appropriate documentation
5. Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Resolved)
1. âœ… **Async operation timeouts**: Fixed by using `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` with appropriate delays
2. âœ… **Mock data inconsistencies**: Resolved by ensuring mock data matches real API responses
3. âœ… **Realm testing issues**: Fixed by using MockRealmService for isolated testing
4. âœ… **Optional comparison errors**: Resolved by proper optional handling and force unwrapping
5. âœ… **Alamofire import errors**: Fixed by adding proper imports for Alamofire types
6. âœ… **Memory leaks**: Properly clean up cancellables and observers in tearDown

### Debug Tips
- Use breakpoints in test methods
- Check console output for detailed error messages
- Verify mock data setup in setUp methods
- Ensure proper test isolation between test methods
- For async tests, use appropriate delays (0.1-0.2 seconds) to allow Combine pipelines to process
- Use `XCTAssertNil` for optional nil checks instead of `XCTAssertEqual` with nil
